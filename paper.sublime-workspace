The flow of water is then directed through a porous medium where the electric power is generated from the electrokinetic streaming potential. With a glass porous medium and a commercial flat sheet FO membrane in a batch mode configuration, our lab scale experimental system has demonstrated the produced electrokinetic voltages of about several hundreds of milli-volts.},\n annote = {Uses ionic concentration differences (salty vs non-salty) to },\ndiff --git a/paper.sublime-workspace b/paper.sublime-workspace\nindex b9fd13a..4dc2399 100644\n--- a/paper.sublime-workspace\n+++ b/paper.sublime-workspace\n@@ -4,6 +4,10 @@\n 		\"selected_items\":\n 		[\n 			[\n+				\"ys_\",\n+				\"ys_toilet\"\n+			],\n+			[\n 				\"is\",\n 				\"is_playing\"\n 			],\n@@ -88,18 +92,30 @@\n 	\"buffers\":\n 	[\n 		{\n+			\"contents\": \"\\\\documentclass[10pt,final,journal]{IEEEtran}\\n\\\\usepackage{amsfonts}\\n\\\\usepackage{amssymb}\\n\\\\usepackage{graphicx}\\n\\\\usepackage{siunitx}\\n\\\\usepackage[usenames, dvipsnames]{color}\\n\\n\\\\title{Feasibility of Harvesting Power To Run A Domestic Water Meter Using Streaming Cell Technology}\\n\\n\\\\author{Mark~H.~Jones, and Prof.~Jonathan~Scott}\\n\\n\\\\begin{document}\\n    \\\\maketitle\\n\\n    \\\\begin{abstract}\\n        We investigate the possibility of using streaming cells as a means of harvesting energy from a town water supply.\\n        We verify streaming cell measurements found in the literature and extend those measurements over a wider range of dimensions.\\n        We measure the electrical power developed from ten streaming cells over a range of pressure differentials using town water.\\n        We estimate the amount of energy required to operate a simple data logger and transmitter.\\n        We estimate the amount of energy available from a typical domestic household based on water usage data.\\n        Finally, we calculate the dimensions required to build a streaming cell harvester large enough to enable domestic water consumption logging and transmission.\\n    \\\\end{abstract}\\n\\n    \\\\section{Introduction}\\n    Domestic and commercial water metering is becoming increasingly important throughout the world.\\n    Having a cheap and reliable way to retrieve metering information is an important consideration for utility companies.\\n    There are two methods available to water utility companies when recording the volume of water delivered to consumers.\\n    \\\\begin{enumerate}\\n        \\\\item \\\\emph{Mechanical readout:}\\n            Involves a meter-reader visually sighting the meter's readout from time to time.\\n            Generally the reading frequency is kept to a minimum and estimate readings are made in the interim.\\n        \\\\item \\\\emph{Electronic telemetry:}\\n            Wireless data transmission is increasingly becoming used as a method of metering data recovery.\\n            Due to the location of water metering, electrical power must be provided by long life batteries.\\n            These batteries are usually non-rechargeable and therefore must be replaced once exhausted.\\n        \\\\end{enumerate}\\n    {\\\\color{blue}[Suggested adding references to the above items.

where ionic concentration is at its highest.\\n    In~\\\\cite{Joly2006} it is suggested that a polarised hydrophobic surface would strongly enhance electro-osmotic effects and therefore further increase conversion efficiency.\\n    Hydrophobic channels have not been considered due to the exotic materials required to build them.\\n\\n    We address the question of whether it is feasible to build a harvester using readily available materials.\\n    Such a harvester must produce enough energy to operate a microprocessor and radio communication device.\\n    It must collect all of its energy from a domestic water supply and be reliable.\\n\\n    The remainder of this work is presented as follows.\\n    In section \\\\ref{sect:streamingCell} we build and measure a simple streaming potential cell.\\n    We confirm the relationship between pressure and applied pressure and investigate the effect of channel height.\\n    In section \\\\ref{sect:waterConsumption} we estimate the amount of harvestable energy from a constructed domestic water usage profile.\\n    Section \\\\ref{sect:powerRequirements} quantifies energy requirements of a simple electronic meter.\\n    {\\\\color{blue} next two sentences ignore.}\\n    Following on this, section \\\\ref{sect:harvesterSize} presents the required cell dimensions to  harvester capable of producing the requisite energy needs.\\n    In section \\\\ref{sect:results} we present the results of our measurements and quantify our predictions.\\n\\n\\n    And finally, we discuss the feasibility of the streaming cell harvester in the conclusion.\\n\\n    \\\\section{Readily Attainable Streaming Cell Power} \\\\label{sect:streamingCell}\\n    In~\\\\cite{Gu2000}, the authors employ a relatively simple parallel plate design to create a streaming cell.\\n    Sandwiching plastic shims between plates of glass provided a simple way to control channel height.\\n    Using that method, the authors of~\\\\cite{Gu2000} fabricated three cells with channel heights of \\\\SI{50}{\\\\micro\\\\metre}, \\\\SI{100}{\\\\micro\\\\metre} and \\\\SI{150}{\\\\micro\\\\metre}.\\n    Each of the channels were \\\\SI{3}{\\\\centi\\\\metre} long and had a inner width of \\\\SI{1}{\\\\centi\\\\metre}.\\n\\n    \\\\begin{figure}\\n        \\\\begin{center}\\n        \\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\linewidth]{Photo_streamingPotential_Assembly_Step3.JPG}\\n        \\\\end{center}\\n        \\\\caption{One of ten constructed streaming cells mounted in an acrylic holder.

\\\\cite{Gu2000} to produce ten streaming cell channels.\\n    The internal dimensions of which are \\\\SI{3}{\\\\centi\\\\metre} long, \\\\SI{1}{\\\\centi\\\\metre} wide and heights in the range of \\\\SI{25}{\\\\micro\\\\metre} to \\\\SI{250}{\\\\micro\\\\metre}.\\n    These dimensions are directly comparable to those of \\\\cite{Gu2000}, where the length and width are the same but the heights span a wider range.\\n    The channels themselves are made from glass microscope slides (Sail Brand - JIA 7101WT) which are sectioned into halves.\\n    Plastic shims (Garlock Colorplast) are epoxied (Selleys Araldite Ultra Clear Resin) between slide halves to create the channels.\\n    The dimensions at each end of each channel are measured under a microscope to determine the actual channel height.\\n\\n    Each channel is epoxied between two acrylic reservoirs and a base plate.\\n    This provides a rigid structure under pressure and provides connection of wires and hoses.\\n    Copper wires and silicon hoses are inserted into each reservoir to facilitate voltage measurement and the application of pressure.\\n    A photo of one of the cells is shown in Fig. \\\\ref{fig:cell}.\\n    \\n    Pressure is applied across each cell by connecting one end to a tap and leaving the other open to atmosphere.\\n    A Honeywell pressure sensor (model 26PC15SMT) is connected across the input/output tubes to measure the developed pressure differential.\\n    An Agilent precision measurement mainframe (model E5270B) is used to measure streaming potential and read the pressure sensor's output.\\n\\n\\n    \\\\section{Estimation of Harvestable Energy From A Typical New Zealand Dwelling}\\n    \\\\label{sect:waterConsumption}\\n    \\\\begin{figure}\\n        \\\\begin{center}\\n
