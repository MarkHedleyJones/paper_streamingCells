abstract = {A direct energy conversion technology based on electrokinetic (EK) phenomenon has attracted an increasing attention during recent years. However, an external driving source (e.g. hydrostatic pressure) is needed to produce an EK flow in microchannels. We recently have developed a novel hybrid energy conversion technique using combined principles of EK and forward osmosis (FO) which directly converts the salinity gradient energy into the electric energy without need of external pressure input. In order to further enhance the power generation efficiency of the FO-EK system, an experimental study is conducted on surface treatment of porous glass (PG) that offers microchannels for EK flow to pass through. The results show that, ultrasonic treatment gives rises to more consistent potential difference and streaming current. SDS surface treatment on PG pretreated by ultrasonic can further enhance EK power generation. In particular, PG treated by ultrasonic and SDS 12 mM yields the best power generation performance with a power density of 3.08 W/m3, an increment of 27.3 \% compared to PG without any surface treatment. In addition, the generated potential difference and streaming current linearly increase with the increasing flow rate. Finally, increasing the flow rate gives rise to higher power density increment.},

abstract = {Pressure-driven flow of an electrolyte solution in a microchannel with charged solid surfaces induces a streaming potential across the microchannel. Such a flow also causes rejection of ions by the microchannel, leading to different concentrations in the feed and permeate reservoirs connecting the capillary, which forms the basis of membrane based separation of electrolytes. Modeling approaches traditionally employed to assess the streaming potential development and ion rejection by capillaries often present a confusing picture of the governing electrochemical transport processes. In this paper, a transient numerical simulation of electrochemical transport process leading to the development of a streaming potential across a finite length circular cylindrical microchannel connecting two infinite reservoirs is presented. The solution based on finite element analysis shows the transient development of ionic concentrations, electric fields, and the streaming potential over the length of the microchannel. The transient analysis presented here resolves several contradictions between the two types of modeling approaches employed in assessing streaming potential development and ion rejection. The simulation results show that the streaming potential across the channel is predominantly set up at the timescale of the developing convective transport, while the equilibrium ion concentrations are developed over a considerably longer duration.},

A single hand push on a syringe is our source of power which easily generates a streaming potential of over 20 V and 30 µA. By means of streaming potentials, two capacitors were charged and discharged alternatively to light-up two Light-Emitting-Diodes in every ten seconds. From our specific choice of liquid/solid pair, an efficiency of 0.8\% was obtained. A mobile-ion-drain method is also demonstrated to increase the streaming potential.},

abstract = {The electrode-tissues interface (ETI) is one of the key issues in implantable devices such as stimulators and sensors. Once the stimulator is implanted, safety and reliability become more and more critical. In this case, modeling and monitoring of the ETI are required. We propose an empirical model for the ETI and a dedicated integrated circuit to measure its corresponding complex impedance. These measurements in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz were achieved in acute dog experiments. The model demonstrates a closer fitting with experimental measurements. In addition, a custom monitoring device based on a stimuli current generator has been completed to evaluate the phase shift and voltage across the electrodes and to transmit wirelessly the values to an external controller. This integrated circuit has been fabricated in a CMOS 0.18 microm process, which consumes 4 mW only during measurements and occupies an area of 1 mm(2).},

abstract = {Embedded systems become more and more widespread, especially autonomous ones, and clearly tend to be ubiquitous. In such systems, low-power and low-energy usage get ever more crucial. Furthermore, these issues also become paramount in (massively) multi-processors systems, either in one machine or more widely in a grid. The various problems faced pertain to autonomy, power supply possibilities, thermal dissipation, or even sheer energy cost. Although it has since long been studied in harware, energy optimization is more recent in software. In this paper, we thus aim at raising awareness to low-power and low-energy issues in the language and compilation community. We thus broadly but briefly survey techniques and solutions to this energy issue, focusing on a few specific aspects in the context of compiler optimizations and memory management.},

Dependence on cation concentration, buffer and cation type, pH, cation valency, and temperature are discussed. The Debye-H\"{u}ckel limit, which is often correctly treated as a good approximation for describing the ion concentration in the double layer, can lead to serious errors if it is extended to predict the dependence of zeta potential on the counterion concentration. For indifferent univalent electrolytes (e.g., sodium and potassium), two simple scalings for the dependence of zeta potential on counterion concentration can be derived in high- and low-zeta limits of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzman equation solution in the double layer. It is shown that for most situations relevant to microchip separations, the high-zeta limit is most applicable, leading to the conclusion that the zeta potential on silica substrates is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the molar counterion concentration. The zeta vs. pH dependence measurements from several experiments are compared by normalizing the zeta based on concentration.},

@article{Shellock2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) issues (magnetic field interactions, MRI-related heating, and artifacts) for a wirelessly powered lead used for spinal cord stimulation (SCS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A newly developed, wirelessly powered lead (Freedom-4, Stimwave Technologies Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) underwent evaluation for magnetic field interactions (translational attraction and torque) at 3 Tesla, MRI-related heating at 1.5 Tesla/64 MHz and 3 Tesla/128 MHz, and artifacts at 3 Tesla using standardized techniques. MRI-related heating tests were conducted by placing the lead in a gelled-saline-filled phantom and performing MRI procedures using relatively high levels of radiofrequency energy. Artifacts were characterized using T1-weighted, spin echo (SE), and gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences.

RESULTS: The lead exhibited minor magnetic field interactions (2 degree deflection angle and no torque). Heating was not substantial under 1.5 Tesla/64 MHz (highest temperature change, 2.3°C) and 3 Tesla/128 MHz (highest temperature change, 2.2°C) MRI conditions. Artifacts were moderate in size relative to the size and shape of the lead.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that it is acceptable for a patient with this wirelessly powered lead used for SCS to undergo MRI under the conditions utilized in this investigation and according to other necessary guidelines. Artifacts seen on magnetic resonance images may pose possible problems if the area of interest is in the same area or close to this lead.},

@article{McCarty2008,
abstract = {This Review discusses ionic electrets: their preparation, their mechanisms of formation, tools for their characterization, and their applications. An electret is a material that has a permanent, macroscopic electric field at its surface; this field can arise from a net orientation of polar groups in the material, or from a net, macroscopic electrostatic charge on the material. An ionic electret is a material that has a net electrostatic charge due to a difference in the number of cationic and anionic charges in the material. Any material that has ions at its surface, or accessible in its interior, has the potential to become an ionic electret. When such a material is brought into contact with some other material, ions can transfer between them. If the anions and cations have different propensities to transfer, the unequal transfer of these ions can result in a net transfer of charge between the two materials. This Review focuses on the experimental evidence and theoretical models for the formation of ionic electrets through this ion-transfer mechanism, and proposes--as a still-unproved hypothesis--that this ion-transfer mechanism may also explain the ubiquitous contact electrification ("static electricity") of materials, such as organic polymers, that do not explicitly have ions at their surface.},

In order to fabricate MEMS-friendly high-performance electret film, CYTOP is adopted as an electret material and the charge density and the charge stability of CYTOP is experimentally characterized. When corona charging is employed, charge density as large as 2.8 mC/m2 is obtained for 3 mm-thick CYTOP film, which is 3 times larger than that of Teflon AF. It is found in thermally-stimulated discharge measure- ment that charge implanted in CYTOP is stable at least up to its glass transition temperature. In power generation experiments using a prototype seismic generator, maximum output power of 6.4 mW is obtained with 1 mmp-p oscillation at 20 Hz. It is also found that the trend of the experimental data is in good accordance with that of the theoretical prediction.},

abstract = {Electroosmotic (EO) micropumps use field-induced ion drag to drive liquids and achieve high pressures in a compact design with no moving parts. An analytical model applicable to planar, etched-structure micropumps has been developed. This model consists of pressure and flow relations in addition to an analytical expression that can be used to estimate the thermody- namic efficiency of planar EO pumps. The analytical model was applied to guide the design of a pump consisting of an etched EO flow chamber for near-optimal hydraulic power performance. To achieve high efficiency, the working fluid used was deionized (DI) water with a conductivity of 3.0 10\^{}-4 S/m (pH = 5.7). The EO micropump was fabricated on a soda-lime glass substrate using standard microlithography and chemical wet etching techniques. The active pumping volume of the device consists of a wet-etched flow channel 1–mm long in the flow direction and 0.9 mby 38-mm in cross section. The pump performance agrees well with the theoretical model. The pump can produce a maximum pressure of 0.33 atm and a maximum flow rate of 15 L/min min at 1 kV.},

Complexities in determining the origin of charge are discussed in the context of design and modeling challenges for electrokinetic actuation in hydrophobic microfluidic devices with aqueous working fluids. Measurements of interfacial charge are complicated by slip and interfacial water structuring phenomena (see Part 2, this issue). Despite these complexities, it is shown that (i) several hydrophobic materials, such as Teflon and Zeonor, have predictable electrokinetic properties and (ii) electrokinetic data for hydrophobic microfluidic systems is most consistent with the postulate that hydroxyl ion adsorption is the origin of charge.},

Properties of solids and liquids are determined mainly by the molecular binding force or the strength of the interactions. The long-range nature of the interactions, such as the exact distance dependence of the force laws plays only a minor role. This chapter investigates in detail the interactions between spheres and particles whose radii are much larger than interatomic spacings. The chapter lists the most common forces encountered between macroscopic particles and extended surfaces interacting in liquids. It also summarizes the special features of different interactions. The chapter illustrates some commonly occurring intermolecular and intersurface potential functions and the different effects they can have on molecule–molecule and particle–particle interactions. The chapter relates the pair potentials between small molecules to those between molecules and surfaces, and between large particles of different geometries. The chapter also explains in detail the concepts related to size effects on interparticle interaction potentials, surface-area-to-volume scaling effects, and dynamic and nonequilibrium effects.},

As a function of salt concentration, it is approximately constant below10 mM, whereas it strongly decreases at higher salt. Changing the sign of the surface charge is found to reverse the streaming current. The data are best modeled using a nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory that includes the salt-dependent hydration state of the silica surface.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of chronic stimulation on the electrical properties of the electrode-tissue system, as measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Silicon, micromachined probes with multiple iridium oxide stimulating electrodes (400-1600 micron 2) were implanted in guinea pig cortex. A 10-17 day post-operative recovery period was followed by five days of monopolar stimulation, two hours/electrode each day using biphasic, constant current stimulation (5-100 microA, 100 microseconds/phase). EIS and CV data were taken before and after stimulation. The post-stimulation impedance [at mid-range frequencies (100 Hz-100 kHz)] consistently and significantly decreased relative to prestimulation levels. Impedance magnitude increased permanently at low frequencies (< 100 Hz), correlating to a change in the charge storage capacity (the area under a cyclic voltammagram). Impedance magnitude significantly increased during the recovery period, though this increase could be mostly reversed by applying small currents. A mathematical model of the electrode-tissue system impedance was used to analyze in vivo behavior. The data and modeling results shows that applying charge to the electrode can consistently reduce the impedance of the electrode-tissue system. Analysis of explanted probes suggests that the interaction between the tissue and electrode is dependent on whether chronic pulses were applied. It is hypothesized that the interface between the tissue and metal is altered by current pulsing, resulting in a temporary impedance shift.},

@article{Sodano1990,
abstract = {The field of power harvesting has experienced significant growth over the past few years due to the ever increasing desire to produce portable and wireless electronics with extended lifespan. Current portable and wireless devices must be designed to include electrochemical batteries as the power source. The use of batteries can be troublesome due to their limited lifespan, thus necessitating their periodic replacement. In the case of wireless sensors that are to be placed in remote locations, the sensor must be easily accessible or of disposable nature to allow the device to function over extended periods of time. Energy scavenging devices are designed to capture the ambient energy surrounding the electronics and convert it into usable electrical energy. The concept of power harvesting works towards developing self- powered devices that do not require replaceable power supplies. A number of sources of harvestable ambient energy exist, including waste heat, vibration, electromagnetic waves, wind, flowing water, and solar energy. While each of these sources of energy can be effectively used to power remote sensors, the structural and biological communities have placed an emphasis on scavenging vibration energy with piezoelectric materials. This article will review recent literature in the field of power harvesting and present the current state of power harvesting in its drive to create completely self-powered devices. Key Words: Piezoelectric, power harvesting, energy scavenging, energy harvesting},

@article{Troy2006,
abstract = {The design of metal microelectrodes that produce minimal damage to tissue and can successfully record from and stimulate targeted neural structures necessitates a thorough understanding of the electrical phenomena generated in the tissue surrounding the electrodes. Computational modeling has been a primary strategy used to study these phenomena, and the Finite Element Method has proven to be a powerful approach. Much research has been directed toward the development of models for electrode recording and stimulation, but very few models reported in the literature thus far incorporate the effects of the electrode-electrolyte interface, which can be a source of very high impedance, and thus likely a key component of the system. To explore the effects that the electrode-electrolyte interface has upon the electric potential and current density surrounding metal microelectrodes, simulations of electrode-saline systems in which the electrodes were driven at AC potentials ranging from 10 mV to 500 mV and frequencies of 100 Hz to 10 kHz have been performed using the Finite Element Method. Solutions obtained using the thin layer approximation for the electrode-electrolyte interface was compared with those generated using a thin uniform layer, a representation that has previously appeared in the literature. Solutions using these two methods were similar in the linear regime of the interface however, the thin layer approximation has important advantages over its competitor including ease of application and low computational cost.},

@article{Kane2013,
abstract = {Penetrating microelectrode arrays with 2000 $\mu$m (2) sputtered iridium oxide (SIROF) electrode sites were implanted in cat cerebral cortex, and their long-term electrochemical performance evaluated in vivo by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and current pulsing. Measurements were made from days 33 to 328 postimplantation. The CV-defined charge storage capacity, measured at 50 mV/s, increased linearly with time over the course of implantation for two arrays and was unchanged for one array. A modest decrease in 1 kHz impedance was also observed. These results suggest an ongoing increase in the apparent electrochemical surface area of the electrodes, which is attributed to electrical leakage pathways arising from cracking of Parylene insulation observed by SEM of explanted arrays. During current pulsing with a 0.0 V interpulse bias, the electrodes readily delivered 8 nC/phase in vitro, but some channels approached or exceeded the water reduction potential during in vivo pulsing. The charge injection capacity in vivo increased linearly with the interpulse bias (0-0.6 V Ag$\backslash$vert AgCl) from 11.5 to 21.8 nC/ph and with pulse width (150-500 $\mu$s) from 8.8 to 14 nC/ph (at 0.0 V bias). These values are lower than those determined from measurements in buffered physiological saline, emphasizing the importance of in vivo measurements in assessing chronic electrode performance. The consequence of current leakage pathways on the charge-injection measurements is also discussed.},

Such surface conductance is found to significantly reduce the figure of merit and thus the efficiency and power output.

@article{Park2010,
abstract = {The no-slip boundary condition for liquid flows in microchannel has been applied successfully although it has no theoretical foundation. Liquid molecules, however, can slip at the liquid-solid interfaces if the liquid has a lower wettability. The velocity slip at the solid wall, called the Navier slip, is proportional to the velocity gradient at the wall for given wall physicochemical properties. Since the electroosmotic flow has a sharp velocity variation at the wall, the Navier slip of electroosmotic flow can be appreciable in a microchannel where there may be negligible Navier slip for a purely pressure-driven flow which has a smoother velocity variation at the wall. The Navier slip affects the volumetric flow rate and streaming potential significantly in electrokinetic flows and, therefore, one must be cautious about the possible occurrence of Navier slip in the design and operation of various microfluidic devices. In the present work, we have devised a simple method of estimating both Navier slip coefficient and zeta potential by measuring both the volumetric flow rate under a given pressure gradient after eliminating streaming potential and streaming potential under a given pressure gradient. Instead of streaming potential, one may adopt volumetric flow rate under a given external electric field. The method relies on a semi-analytic formula derived in the present work, which allows evaluation of streaming potential and volumetric flow rate without the necessity of numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. The present method is found to estimate both slip coefficient and zeta potential reasonably accurately even using contaminated experimental data.},

abstract = {The competition between streaming potential effect and hydrodynamic slip effect in pressure-driven microchannel flows is elucidated. The treatment is performed analytically in the framework of the Debye–H\"{u}ckel linear approximation and the Navier slip boundary condition. As compared with pressure- driven flows in nonslip microchannels, pressure-driven flows in microchannels with hydrodynamic slippage are found to experience severer flow reduction (streaming potential effect). An apparent viscos- ity ratio is also defined to identify the competition between streaming potential effect and hydrodynamic slip effect in pressure-driven microchannel flows. It is shown that the streaming potential effect predom- inates when this ratio is larger than unity and the slip effect predominates when this ratio is smaller than unity. More importantly, we derive a formula for the critical slip length which provides a guideline for designing hydrophobic surfaces over which the effect of hydrodynamic slip exactly counteracts that of streaming potential. ©},

abstract = {The strong demand for renewable energy promotes research on novel methods and technologies for energy conversion. Microfluidic systems for energy conversion by streaming current are less known to the public, and the relatively low efficiencies previously obtained seemed to limit the further applications of such systems. Here we report a microdroplet-based electrostatic generator operating by an acceleration-deceleration cycle ('ballistic' conversion), and show that this principle enables both high efficiency and compact simple design. Water is accelerated by pumping it through a micropore to form a microjet breaking up into fast-moving charged droplets. Droplet kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy when the charged droplets decelerate in the electrical field that forms between membrane and target. We demonstrate conversion efficiencies of up to 48\%, a power density of 160 kW m(-2) and both high- (20 kV) and low- (500 V) voltage operation. Besides offering striking new insights, the device potentially opens up new perspectives for low-cost and robust renewable energy conversion.},

abstract = {In the present work we explore some aspects of energy harvesting from unsteady, turbulent fluid flow using piezoelectric generators. Turbulent flows exhibit a large degree of coherence in their spatial and temporal scales, which provides a unique opportunity for energy harvesting. The voltage generated by short, flexible piezoelectric cantilever beams placed inside turbulent boundary layers and wakes of circular cylinders at high Reynolds numbers is inves- tigated. Matching the fluid flow’s predominant frequency with the natural frequency of the piezoelectric generator appears to maximize the piezoelectric output voltage. This voltage is also dependent on the generator’s location inside the flow field. A three-way coupled interaction simulation that takes into account the aerodynamics, structural vibration, and electrical response of the piezoelectric generator has been developed. The simulation results agree rea- sonably well with the experimental data paving the way of using such a tool to estimate the performance of different energy harvesting devices within unsteady flow fields.},

abstract = {The taming of electricity and its widespread use allows people to see in the dark, to speak to one another instantaneously across the earth, and it allows retrieval of data from instruments sent out of the solar system. It is right to expect that the uses and demand for electricity will continue to grow, and to extend the ability to generate electricity; here two new micromachined devices for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy are presented. Aided by the wealth of micromachining process technology, generators that use an oscillatory motion to modify the physical structure of a capacitor with a built-in electric field provided by a permanent electret have been designed, built, and tested. The electret creates an electric field inside the capacitor structure, which induces mirror charge at some potential. The modification of the capacitor then generates an alternating displacement current through an external circuit, which provides useful electrical power. The electret microphone is a similar well known device for converting pressure waves into electrical signals by varying the distance between two charged capacitive plates. This work explores and proves feasible the ability to use mechanical forces to change the overlapping area of a charged capacitor structure and using mechanical forces to move a liquid into the gap of a charged capacitor structure, changing its permittivity to produce electricity. This work demonstrates 2.5mW of power from a 2cm diameter rotary generator at 12kRPM and 10$\mu$w for a 0.1cm3 linear shaking generator at 60Hz.},

Also, for a constant average potential on the channel wall, the difference between the results based on three kinds of boundary conditions, which include constant surface charge, constant surface potential, and charge-regulated surface, is inappreciable if the hydraulic diameter is larger than 1 mum.},

abstract = {We present a molecular dynamics simulation study of the structure and dynamics of water confined between silica surfaces using beta-cristobalite as a model template. We scale the surface Coulombic charges by means of a dimensionless number, k, ranging from 0 to 1, and thereby we can model systems ranging from hydrophobic apolar to hydrophilic, respectively. Both rotational and translational dynamics exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on k characterized by a maximum in the in-plane diffusion coefficient, D||, at values between 0.6 and 0.8, and a minimum in the rotational relaxation time, tauR, at k=0.6. The slow dynamics observed in the proximity of the hydrophobic apolar surface are a consequence of beta-cristobalite templating an ice-like water layer. The fully hydrophilic surfaces (k=1.0), on the other hand, result in slow interfacial dynamics due to the presence of dense but disordered water that forms strong hydrogen bonds with surface silanol groups. Confinement also induces decoupling between translational and rotational dynamics, as evidenced by the fact that tauR attains values similar to that of the bulk, while D|| is always lower than in the bulk. The decoupling is characterized by a more drastic reduction in the translational dynamics of water compared to rotational relaxation.},

abstract = {Electrodes are widely used to measure bioelectric events and to stimulate excitable tissues. In one form or another, electrodes have been around for nearly two centuries; yet our ability to predict their properties is extremely limited, despite considerable research, especially during the last century. This paper chronicles the accumulation of knowledge about the electrode-electrolyte interface as a circuit element. Our understanding of this interface starts with the Helmholtz double layer of charge and progresses through the Warburg and Fricke low-current-density models, which demonstrated that the resistive and capacitive components are polarization elements, the values of which depend on frequency. The discovery by Schwan, showing that the components of the Warburg-Fricke model are current-density dependent, is recounted, along with the discovery of the rectifying properties of the electrode-electrolyte interface and how it was put to practical use. The very high current-density operation of the interface is discussed in terms of gas evolution, arching, and shock-wave production. Finally the evolution of recording electrodes is traced. Because electrodes can be operated over a very wide range of current density, it is unlikely that a single model can be created for the electrode-electrolyte interface, although over a restricted current-density range such a model may be possible.},

abstract = {The field of nonlinear “induced-charge” electrokinetics is rapidly advancing, motivated by potential applications in microfluidics as well as by the unique opportunities it provides for probing fundamental scientific issues in electrokinetics. Over the past few years, several surprising theoretical predictions have been observed in experiments: (i) induced-charge electrophoresis of half-metallic Janus particles, perpendicular to a uniform AC field; (ii) microfluidic mixing around metallic structures by induced-charge electro-osmosis, and (iii) fast, high-pressure AC electro-osmotic pumping by non-planar electrode arrays, and ICEK effects upon the collective behavior of polarizable particle suspensions has been studied theoretically and computationally. A new experimental system enables a clean and direct comparison between theoretical predictions and measured ICEK flows, providing a route to fundamental studies of particular surfaces and high-throughput searches for optimal ICEK systems. Systematic discrepancies between theory and experiment have engendered the search for mechanisms, including new theories that account for electrochemical surface reactions, surface contamination, roughness, and the crowding of ions at high voltage. Promising directions for further research, both fundamental and applied, are discussed.},

abstract = {To elaborate on the applicability of the electrokinetic micro power generation, we designed and fabricated the silicon-glass as well as the PDMS-glass microfluidic chips with the unique features of a multi-channel. Besides miniaturizing the device, the key advantage of our microfluidic chip utilization lies in the reduction in water flow rate. Both a distributor and a collector taking the tapered duct geometry are positioned aiming the uniform distribution of water flow into all individual channels of the chip, in which several hundreds of single microchannels are assembled in parallel. A proper methodology is developed accompanying the deep reactive ion etching as well as the anodic bonding, and optimum process conditions necessary for hard and soft micromachining are presented. It has been shown experimentally and theoretically that the silicon-based microchannel leads to increasing streaming potential and higher external current compared to those of the PDMS-based one. A proper comparison between experimental results and theoretical computations allows justification of the validity of our novel devices. It is useful to recognize that a material inducing a higher magnitude of zeta potential has an advantage for obtaining higher power density under the same external resistance.},

abstract = {Pressure-driven flow in a microchannel induces a streaming current due to the presence of an electrical double layer in the interface between the electrolyte solution and channel wall. As the streaming current is of the order of a nano-amphere and is additive, we propose here a method to develop an electrokinetic battery consisting of an array of microchannels that converts the hydrostatic pressure of a liquid into electrical work. We have given oscillating analytical solutions by means of an electrical circuit analysis to model the multi-microchannel battery. Using superposition of the appropriate Fourier series, the derived analytical solutions are useful to predict the current when there is more general time-dependent flow through a microchannel array. To illustrate the idea, we have studied steady-state pressure-driven flow in micropore porous glass filter and compared the results with those predicted from our model. From a 30 cm hydrostatic pressure drop, an external current of 1–2 µA was obtained by means of water passing through the micropore porous glass filter. A larger current can be obtained by simply using a solution with higher salt concentration. This results in a new and potentially useful method of energy conversion by means of an array of microchannels.},

@article{Ren2008a,
abstract = {We investigate theoretically the influence of hydrodynamic slip at the surface of a nanofluidic channel on the efficiency with which electrokinetic phenomena can be used to convert hydrostatic energy to electrical power. Slip is introduced by applying the Navier boundary condition to the pressure-driven and the electro-osmotic components of the fluid velocity. A strong enhancement in the efficiency is predicted for increasing slip length due to the resulting decrease in the fluidic impedance and increase in the streaming conductance. These effects are moderated by a decrease in the electrical impedance, which promotes dissipation. The maximum efficiency approaches 100\% as the slip length diverges, and a potentially practical 40\% efficiency is expected for a moderate 30 nm slip length in a 10 nm high channel. Recently reported slip lengths for carbon nanotube filters suggest that efficiencies above 70\% and high power densities might be achieved in a graphitic system.},

Nanofluidic studies were categorized into two groups depending on the characteristic length scale. When the size of the nanochannels and pores is 5-100 nm, electrostatic interactions are dominant, and ion and fluid flow can be analyzed by continuum dynamics. Various nanofluidic devices were proposed to manipulate aqueous solutions and biomolecules at the nanoscale. The successful development of such systems has major implications for technologies focusing on water purification and processing of complex biological solutions. When the size is less than 5 nm, steric interactions and hydration affect ion and fluid flow, which is analyzed by stochastic and/or molecular dynamics.},

@article{Duan2004,
abstract = {This paper presents methods, results and analysis for measurements of the electrochemical impedance of platinum electrodes (approximately 0.43 mm2) over a 6-month implantation in the cat cochlea. The study aimed to improve our understanding of the effects of tissue response on impedance behaviour. An increase in impedance in the post-operative period was evident with a rise of the distorted arc at high frequencies in the complex plane, correlating to anomalous charge transport at the electrode-tissue interface. The impedance at low frequencies generally showed a capacitive dispersion modelled as a constant phase element, indicating a blocking characteristic of the electrodes. The study suggests that a reduction and changes in composition of perilymph or extracellular fluid adjacent to the electrodes, as a consequence of tissue response, causes the elevated "contact impedance". This affects the efficiency and quality of neural stimulating electrodes and neural recording electrodes. The finding of the crucial role of perilymph or extracellular fluid thin layer provides a new strategy for surface materials of neural electrodes, which is discussed in the paper. The interface characteristics must be considered during interpretation of studies undertaken in vitro or in acute experiments in vivo, where physiological fluid is abundant.},

@article{Olthuis2005,
abstract = {Using a Surface Forces Apparatus we have measured changes in the electrical potential difference between quartz and mica surfaces that correlate with the changing quartz dissolution rate when surfaces are pressed together at relatively low pressures (2-3 atm) in aqueous electrolyte solutions of 30 mM CaCl2 at 25 C. No detectable dissolution or voltage potential difference is measured in symmetrical systems (e.g. mica-mica or quartz-quartz) or between dry surfaces subjected to similar pressures, indicating that the dissolution can not be attributed to a simple pressure effect, slow aging (creep), or plastic deformation of the quartz surface. In quartz-mica systems brought together under pressure or to close proximity in electrolyte solution, the onset of quartz dissolution is marked by a sudden, rapid decrease in the quartz thickness at initial rates in the range from 1 to 4 nm/min, which after several hours settles into a constant rate of approximately 0.01 nm/min (\~{}5 mum/yr). Concomitantly, the potential drops to a constant value once the dissolution rate has stabilized. The decrease in the decay rate is interpreted as being due to saturation of the confined aqueous film and/or to the buildup of a Stern layer on the quartz surface, and the constant rate as being due to the steady-state chemical dissolution and diffusion of the dissolving silica into the surrounding reservoir. The dissolution is `non-uniform': the surfaces become rough as dissolution proceeds, with the appearance of pits in a manner analogous to corrosion. On occasions, the process of rapid dissolution followed by a gradual transition to steady dissolution repeats itself, suggesting that the pit structure and Stern layer are fragile and subject to collapse and/or expulsion from the gap. Preliminary experiments on the dissolution of multi-faceted milled quartz particles (\~{}1.0 mum diameter) compressed between two muscovite surfaces suggest an asymmetry in the dissolution rates at different crystallographic planes. The origin of the electrical potential is interpreted as arising from the overlapping of the electric double-layers of two dissimilar surfaces when they are forced into close proximity. This electrical potential difference, for as yet unknown reasons, appears to be the driving force for the dissolution, rather than pressure.},

abstract = {A system formed by two phases bathing amicroporous membrane is studied considering its behavior as a dynamic system. So, the natural frequencies for each used membrane is determined and then, applying a flow ramp with a rate sufficiently small, the streaming potential can be obtained from the slope of the pressure values versus electrical potential. The determination of the electric potential inside the pores, $\phi$, requires to solve the Poisson–B\"{o}ltzmann equation in the case of membranes with pore diameter in the range of thickness, for which the radial components of velocity of the fluid must be considered. Since there is no analytical solution, a numerical method was used to obtain $\phi$. The electrical potential value at a distance equal to hydrodynamic radius from pore axis (zeta potential) is used to evaluate the streaming potential by the Helmholtz–Smoluchowsky relation. These values were compared with the experimental data accomplishing the suitable iterations over the surface charge density until coincidence. The values of the surface charge density for the studied membranes show a concentration dependence described by Lang- muir’s model for the greatest pore diameters and Freundlich’s model for the smallest pore diameters. ©1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Electrical stimulation of nerve tissue and recording of neural electrical activity are the basis of emerging prostheses and treatments for spinal cord injury, stroke, sensory deficits, and neurological disorders. An understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms underlying the behavior of neural stimulation and recording electrodes is important for the development of chronically implanted devices, particularly those employing large numbers of microelectrodes. For stimulation, materials that support charge injection by capacitive and faradaic mechanisms are available. These include titanium nitride, platinum, and iridium oxide, each with certain advantages and limitations. The use of charge-balanced waveforms and maximum electrochemical potential excursions as criteria for reversible charge injection with these electrode materials are described and critiqued. Techniques for characterizing electrochemical properties relevant to stimulation and recording are described with examples of differences in the in vitro and in vivo response of electrodes.},

The principle of the proposed method encompasses forward osmosis (FO) and electrokinetic phenomena. With the salinity difference between draw and feed solutions, FO allows spontaneous water flow across a semi-permeable membrane. The flow of water is then directed through a porous medium where the electric power is generated from the electrokinetic streaming potential. With a glass porous medium and a commercial flat sheet FO membrane in a batch mode configuration, our lab scale experimental system has demonstrated the produced electrokinetic voltages of about several hundreds of milli-volts.},

abstract = {Signal degradation and an array size dictated by the number of available interconnects are the two main limitations inherent to standalone microelectrode arrays (MEAs). A new biochip consisting of an array of microelectrodes with fully-integrated analog and digital circuitry realized in an industrial CMOS process addresses these issues. The device is capable of on-chip signal filtering for improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), on-chip analog and digital conversion, and multiplexing, thereby facilitating simultaneous stimulation and recording of electrogenic cell activity. The designed electrode pitch of 250 microm significantly limits the space available for circuitry: a repeated unit of circuitry associated with each electrode comprises a stimulation buffer and a bandpass filter for readout. The bandpass filter has corner frequencies of 100 Hz and 50 kHz, and a gain of 1000. Stimulation voltages are generated from an 8-bit digital signal and converted to an analog signal at a frequency of 120 kHz. Functionality of the read-out circuitry is demonstrated by the measurement of cardiomyocyte activity. The microelectrode is realized in a shifted design for flexibility and biocompatibility. Several microelectrode materials (platinum, platinum black and titanium nitride) have been electrically characterized. An equivalent circuit model, where each parameter represents a macroscopic physical quantity contributing to the interface impedance, has been successfully fitted to experimental results.},

However, the induced voltages are typically of the order of a few millivolts, too small for significant power generation. Here we perform tests involving water flow with various molarities of hydrochloric acid (HCl) over few-layered graphene and report order of magnitude higher induced voltages for graphene as compared to nanotubes. The power generated by the flow of 0.6 M HCl solution at 0.01 m/sec was measured to be 85 nW for a 30 16 m size graphene film, which equates to a power per unit area of 175 W/m(2). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the power generation is primarily caused by a net drift velocity of adsorbed Cl(-) ions on the continuous graphene film surface.},

Here, we describe the use of liquid water microjets for direct conversion of electrokinetic energy to electrical power. Previous studies of electrokinetic power production have reported low efficiencies (3\%), limited by back conduction of ions at the surface and in the bulk liquid. Liquid microjets eliminate energy dissipation due to back conduction and, measuring only at the jet target, yield conversion efficiencies exceeding 10\%.},

A correction method is suggested to esti- mate numerically the inducedzetapotential on the conducting surface.Two-dimensional pressure-linked Navier–Stokes equation is used to model the flow field in the channel. The numerical results show flow circulations generated from the induced non-uniform zeta potential distribution along the conducting hurdle surfaces. It is demonstrated that the local flow circulations provide effective means to enhance the flowmixing between different solutions. The mixing enhancement effect is experimentally validated using PDMS based microchannels with embedded platinum hurdles. The dependence of the degree of mixing enhancement on the hurdle geometries and hurdle numbers is also predicted. The mixing using ICEKF described in this paper can be used in various microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip applications.},

abstract = {We investigate theoretically the influence of hydrodynamic slip at the surface of a nanofluidic channel on the efficiency with which electrokinetic phenomena can be used to convert hydrostatic energy to electrical power. Slip is introduced by applying the Navier boundary condition to the pressure-driven and the electro-osmotic components of the fluid velocity. A strong enhancement in the efficiency is predicted for increasing slip length due to the resulting decrease in the fluidic impedance and increase in the streaming conductance. These effects are moderated by a decrease in the electrical impedance, which promotes dissipation. The maximum efficiency approaches 100\% as the slip length diverges, and a potentially practical 40\% efficiency is expected for a moderate 30 nm slip length in a 10 nm high channel. Recently reported slip lengths for carbon nanotube filters suggest that efficiencies above 70\% and high power densities might be achieved in a graphitic system.},

abstract = {We consider the influence of an electric field applied normal to the electric double layer at a chemically reactive surface. Our goal is to elucidate how surface chemistry affects the potential for field-effect control over micro- and nanofluidic systems, which we call electrofluidic gating. The charging of a metal-oxide-electrolyte (MOE) capacitor is first modeled analytically. We apply the Poisson-Boltzmann description of the double layer and impose chemical equilibrium between the ionizable surface groups and the solution at the solid-liquid interface. The chemically reactive surface is predicted to behave as a buffer, regulating the charge in the double layer by either protonating or deprotonating in response to the applied field. We present the dependence of the charge density and the electrochemical potential of the double layer on the applied field, the density, and the dissociation constants of ionizable surface groups and the ionic strength and the pH of the electrolyte. We simulate the responses of SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3), two widely used oxide insulators with different surface chemistries. We also consider the limits to electrofluidic gating imposed by the nonlinear behavior of the double layer and the dielectric strength of oxide materials, which were measured for SiO(2) and Al(2)O(3) films in MOE configurations. Our results clarify the response of chemically reactive surfaces to applied fields, which is crucial to understanding electrofluidic effects in real devices.},

With advanced nanotechnologies, artificial gels (e.g. nanopillar arrays, nanofilters) can be manufactured with controlled and ordered geometries. This contrast with gels, where the pores are disordered and the range of available pore sizes is limited by the level of cross-linking and the mechanical properties of the gel. In this review, we recall the theories developed for free-solution and gel electrophoresis (extended Ogston model, biased reptation and entropic trapping) and from this perspective, suggestions for future concepts for fast DNA separation using nanostructures will be given.},

@article{Franks2005,
abstract = {A low electrode-electrolyte impedance interface is critical in the design of electrodes for biomedical applications. To design low-impedance interfaces a complete understanding of the physical processes contributing to the impedance is required. In this work a model describing these physical processes is validated and extended to quantify the effect of organic coatings and incubation time. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to electrically characterize the interface for various electrode materials: platinum, platinum black, and titanium nitride; and varying electrode sizes: 1 cm2, and 900 microm2. An equivalent circuit model comprising an interface capacitance, shunted by a charge transfer resistance, in series with the solution resistance has been fitted to the experimental results. Theoretical equations have been used to calculate the interface capacitance impedance and the solution resistance, yielding results that correspond well with the fitted parameter values, thereby confirming the validity of the equations. The effect of incubation time, and two organic cell-adhesion promoting coatings, poly-L-lysine and laminin, on the interface impedance has been quantified using the model. This demonstrates the benefits of using this model in developing better understanding of the physical processes occurring at the interface in more complex, biomedically relevant situations.},

This text is not a summary of current research in the field, and it omits any discussion of microfabrication techniques or any attempt to summarise the technological state of the art. This text serves as a useful reference for practising researchers but is designed primarily for classroom instruction.

However, the induced voltages are typically of the order of a few millivolts, too small for significant power generation. Here we perform tests involving water flow with various molarities of hydrochloric acid (HCl) over few-layered graphene and report order of magnitude higher induced voltages for graphene as compared to nanotubes. The power generated by the flow of 0.6 M HCl solution at 0.01 m/sec was measured to be 85 nW for a 30 16 m size graphene film, which equates to a power per unit area of 175 W/m(2). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the power generation is primarily caused by a net drift velocity of adsorbed Cl(-) ions on the continuous graphene film surface.},
